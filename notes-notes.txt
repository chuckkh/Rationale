All notes, all regions and the hover have:
numerator
denominator
cent value (offset)
??

All notes have a bend envelope!

notebanks may take images to be used as accidentals?


All notes have a channel value (hidden from user).
By default, it is -1.

a 16-bit int! can be stored just before every noteon and just after every noteoff to show which channels are available.

When notes are added during playback, they use a channel from this ChannelMask.



The MIDI interface is always open.
pitch bend / notes must be sent in several circumstances:
1. playback
2. scrubbing over the score
3. adding notes
4. moving notes vertically (play all notes sounding at that time)







MIDI:
Assign MIDI devices to instruments.
Controllers in addition to instruments. Or arbitrary values??
pitch bend *offset* per instrument *and* per note!!!
