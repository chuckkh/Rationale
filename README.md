To run Rationale, either type "python rationale.py" in the Rationale folder, or double-click the file, if your system is set up to run Python files that way.  Simple executables for Windows and Mac are on the way, for those who find typing words too confusing.

Rationale is designed to run using the version of Tkinter provided with the latest version of Python.  It uses the JUCE framework.

The idea behind Rationale is that consonance is linked to frequency ratios, specifically integer ratios.  Two notes that are an "octave" apart, for instance, will have frequencies in the ratio of 2:1.  A perfect fifth, 3:2.  A perfect fourth, 4:3.  The notes in a major triad have the ratio 4:5:6.
